# Rossmann Pharmaceuticals: Sales Forecasting Challenge (10 Academy Week 4)

## Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals, you are tasked with creating an end-to-end solution to forecast store sales six weeks in advance. This solution will empower the finance team and store managers to make data-driven decisions by considering factors like promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

## Key Tasks

### Task 1: **Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior**

1. **Objective:** Understand and analyze the impact of various factors on sales, including promotions, holidays, and assortment types.
2. **Steps:**
   - Clean the data (handle outliers, missing values, and inconsistencies).
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
   - Investigate correlations, seasonal patterns, and customer behavior.
3. **Deliverables:**
   - Jupyter notebook with EDA insights.
   - Logger-based implementation for reproducibility.

### Task 2: **Prediction of Store Sales**

1. **Objective:** Build a machine learning model to forecast daily store sales.
2. **Steps:**
   - **Preprocessing:** Feature engineering and scaling.
   - **Model Building:** Train regression models (e.g., Random Forest) using sklearn pipelines.
   - **Post-prediction Analysis:** Evaluate feature importance and confidence intervals.
   - **Model Serialization:** Save models with timestamps for traceability.
   - **Deep Learning:** Develop an LSTM model for time-series forecasting.
3. **Deliverables:**
   - Serialized models.
   - Jupyter notebook with ML and deep learning implementation.

### Task 3: **Model Serving API**

1. **Objective:** Serve the trained models via a REST API.
2. **Steps:**
   - Develop an API using Flask or FastAPI.
   - Load serialized models for predictions.
   - Implement endpoints to accept inputs and return predictions.
   - Deploy the API for real-time accessibility.
3. **Deliverables:**
   - Fully functional REST API.
